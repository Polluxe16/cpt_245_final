This is the final project made for the CPT 245 Java Programming class by Aiden Robbins. 

This final was pretty interesting to complete. The instructions were put together well, and having a copy of the completed assignment was very useful for comparison. 
I followed the steps, uploaded the files to the repository, and then compared my code with the completed one provided, making changes and correcting errors as I went through. 
I also added the files that were not shown in the steps but were in the completed project provided, such as the TodoItemNotFoundException file, as I figured they would likely be good to add even though they were left unmentioned.

I hope that this project lives up to your expectations.
